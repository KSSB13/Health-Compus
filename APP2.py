    A big change in the approach towards student health is happening where it is getting proactive and data-driven nowadays. 
    Students are concerned with different types of health issues including seasonal diseases, allergies, and drug adherence. 
    In most cases, traditional reactive healthcare systems lack information that students desperately need.

    **Overview of Health Compass Project:**
    - **Individualized Healthcare:** A growing focus on making medical care more suitable for individuals. Health Compass echoes this trend by giving personalized insights from anonymous data analysis.
    - **Technology as a means of managing health:** Research has shown the positive effects of technology on health management. By providing data-based insights and self-management tools for students, Health Compass empowers them.
    - **Significance of community backup:** Psychosocial support is important in maintaining wellness. On the other hand interactive features within the Health Compass may just promote individual welfare.
    - **Student health:** Universities recognize how important student wellness is and are taking measures to enhance it. In line with this, Health Compass offers focused interventions aimed at improving the health of students.
